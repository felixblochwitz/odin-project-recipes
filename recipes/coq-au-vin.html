        <h3>What you need:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            2 whole small chickens, cut into 4 pieces, backbones reserved for
            stock
          </li>
          <li>2 cups dry red vine</li>
          <li>8 ounces pearl onions</li>
          <li>
            1/4 pound slab bacon or salt pork, cut into 1- by 1/4- by 1/4-inch
            sticks
          </li>
          <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
          <li>
            8 ounces button or cremini mushrooms, woody stems drimmed if
            necessary, quartered
          </li>
          <li>3 medium carrots, diced (about 1 1/2 cups)</li>
          <li>4 medium cloves garlic, crushed</li>
          <li>2 sprigs thyme</li>
          <li>2 bay leaves</li>
          <li>
            2 cups gelatinous homemade chicken stock (see notes) or low-sodium
            chicken broth
          </li>
          <li>3 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, cubed</li>
          <li>1/4 cup minced flat-leaf parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What you do:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Add chicken to a 1-gallon zipper-lock
            bag. Pour in wine and seal bag, pressing out air. Let stand while
            you prepare the remaining ingredients.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using a paring knife, trim off the ends of each onion and score a
            light "X" into one cut side. Bring a small pot of water to a boil
            over high heat. Add onions and cook until outer layers are soft,
            about 1 1/2 minutes. Drain onions and run under cool water until
            cold enough to handle. Peel onions with your fingers and discard
            peels.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large Dutch oven or rondeau, cook bacon over medium-high heat,
            stirring and reducing heat as necessary to prevent scorching, until
            browned and fat has rendered, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat
            and, using a slotted spoon, transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined
            plate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove chicken from zipper-lock bag, reserving wine, and pat dry.
            Season with salt and pepper. Return Dutch oven with rendered bacon
            fat to medium-high heat and, working in batches, add chicken, skin
            side down, and cook until browned, about 7 minutes. Turn and brown
            other side, about 5 minutes. Transfer browned chicken to a wire rack
            set over a rimmed baking sheet. Reserve at room temperature.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once all chicken is browned, add mushrooms to Dutch oven and cook
            over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until browned, 10 to 12
            minutes. Add pearl onions, carrots, and garlic and cook, stirring,
            until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Add bacon, wine, thyme, and
            bay leaves and bring to a simmer, stirring up any browned bits.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir in stock. Add chicken legs skin side up, nestling them into the
            Dutch oven so that they are partially submerged but top of skin is
            above the liquid. Pour in any accumulated juices from chicken.
            Transfer to oven and cook, uncovered, for 1 hour.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add chicken breasts, nestling them skin side up amongst the legs,
            and return to the oven. Cook until breasts are just cooked through
            (they should register 145 to 150°F/63°C to 66°C on an instant-read
            thermometer), about 20 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Transfer chicken breasts and legs to a clean rack set over a rimmed
            backing sheet. Set Dutch oven over medium-low heat and simmer until
            sauce is lightly viscous, about 10 minutes. Whisk in butter, then
            season with salt (if necessary) and pepper. Stir in half of parsley.
          </li>
          <li>
            Return chicken to pot, spooning sauce on top. Garnish with remaining
            parsley. Serve right away with buttered potatoes, pasta, or rice.
          </li>
        </ol>
