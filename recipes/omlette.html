        <h3>What you need:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>3 large eggs</li>
          <li>15g (1 tablespoon) unsalted butter</li>
          <li>Kosher salt</li>
          <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>What you do:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a medium bowl, beat eggs with a disposable plastic or reusable
            wooden fork just until last traces of white are mixed in; season
            with salt and pepper.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a <strong>perfectly</strong> unscratched 8-inch nonstick skillet,
            melt butter, swirling over moderate heat, until fully melted and
            foamy but not browned. Add eggs and stir rapidly with fork, tines
            up, while shaking pan to agitate eggs; make sure to move fork all
            around pan to break up curds and scrape them from bottom of skillet
            as they form. Stop stirring as soon as eggs are very softly
            scrambled and creamy (but still loose enough to come together into a
            single mass), 1 to 2 minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Using fork, <strong>gently</strong> spread egg in an even layer
            around skillet and scrape down any wispy bits around the edges. The
            top surface should be loose and creamy, but if it looks too liquid
            and raw, cook undisturbed for another few seconds. (If it still
            flows, you can swirl skillet to send loose egg to the edges, where
            it will set more quickly.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Remove from heat, tilt skillet up by its handle, and, using fork,
            <strong>gently</strong>
            roll omelette down over itself until it is nearly folded in half.
            Using fork, push omelette to edge of skillet so that lower edge of
            egg begins to just barely overhang; use fork to fold overhanging
            edge of egg up, closing omelette.
          </li>
          <li>
            Hold skillet right over plate and turn omelette out onto it. It
            should be almond- or cigar-shaped, with the seam on bottom; if it's
            not, lay a clean kitchen towel over it and use your hands to adjust
            its shape and position, then remove towel. <strong>Serve</strong>.
            (To make another omelette, wipe any eggy bits out of skillet and
            repeat.)
          </li>
        </ol>
