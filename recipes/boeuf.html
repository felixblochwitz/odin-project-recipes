      <li>1 tablespoon (15ml) soy sauce</li>
      <li>
        1 bouquet garni (about 4 sprigs thyme, 3 sprigs parsley, and 1 bay leaf,

      </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons (20g) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>

      <li>8 ounces white and/or red pearl onions (225g), peeled</li>
      <li>Minced flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems, for garnish</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What you do:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat oven to 300°F (150°C). Pour chicken stock into a medium bowl and
        sprinkle gelatin evenly all over surface, allowing each packet's worth
        of gelatin to soak up stock before sprinkling next one on. Set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a large Dutch oven, heat oil over medium-high heat until shimmering.
        Season beef all over with salt and pepper and add to Dutch oven. Cook,
        turning occasionally, until beef is well browned on 2 sides, about 10
        minutes. Transfer beef to a rimmed baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add split carrots, halved onions, and garlic to Dutch oven and cook,
        turning occasionally, until lightly browned, about 4 minutes; lower heat
        if browned bits on bottom of Dutch oven threaten to burn.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add brandy, if using, and boil until alcohol has nearly cooked off,
        about 2 minutes. (If not using brandy, proceed with next step.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Scrape chicken stock and all gelatin into Dutch oven. Add red wine, fish
        sauce, soy sauce, and bouquet garni and bring to a simmer, then lower
        heat to maintain simmer. Meanwhile, cut beef into 2-inch chunks and
        transfer to a large mixing bowl. Add flour and stir until beef is evenly
        coated in a floury paste. Add beef and any accumulated juices to Dutch
        oven. Transfer to oven, cover with lid partially open, and cook until
        beef is starting to become tender, about 1 hour 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, in a large skillet, cook lardons over medium-high heat,
        stirring occasionally, until fat has rendered and lardons are lightly
        browned and crisp, about 6 minutes. Transfer lardons to a plate with a
        slotted spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add mushrooms to skillet and cook, stirring occasionally, until
        mushrooms have released their liquid and browned, about 12 minutes; add
        oil as needed if pan becomes too dry. Add diced carrots and pearl onions
        and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned,
        about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove stew from oven. Using tongs, fish out and discard large pieces of
        carrot and onion. Discard bouquet garni. Using a ladle, skim off and
        discard accumulated fat on surface. Add reserved lardons and sautéed
        carrots, onions, and mushrooms to stew, return to oven, and continue to
        cook, uncovered, until beef is tender, about 30 minutes longer.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove stew from oven. If serving right away, skim off any additional
        fat from surface. Season with salt and pepper, if needed. Allow to cool
        slightly before serving, then serve topped with parsley. If making
        ahead, cool down stew, then chill in refrigerator; remove solid fat cap
        from surface once fully chilled. Reheat stew on the stovetop or in a low
        oven.
      </li>

      Here's a video of some french guy cooking the dish (probably differently
      than in the recipe above. I have no idea. Just chose the video for the
      french accent)
